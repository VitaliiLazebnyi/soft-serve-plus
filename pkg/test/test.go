// RandomPort returns a TCP port that is free on IPv4 loopback and, where the
// machine has it, IPv6 loopback, and that no other caller of RandomPort, in
// this process or another, has been given. A client dialing "localhost" may
// try either address, so a port in use on one of them would reach the wrong
// server.
//
// The TCP port itself cannot be held open: the server under test binds it
// later, often in another process. Checking that it is free is not enough on
// its own, since go test runs packages, and developers run worktrees, as
// separate processes that all pick from the same range, and two of them can
// pick the same free port before either server binds it. So each returned
// port is also reserved by binding the same port number on UDP loopback,
// which TCP listeners do not conflict with, and holding that socket for the
// life of the process. Another process's RandomPort cannot bind it, so it
// skips the port. The OS releases the reservation when the process exits.
//
// Only a port that is in use is skipped. Any other error, such as running out
// of file descriptors or a sandbox that forbids binding, would fail for every
// port, so RandomPort panics with it instead of retrying forever. It also
// panics when it finds no free port after maxAttempts tries, for example
// because concurrent test processes hold most of the range.
//
// Reservations are never released, so one process gets at most
// maxPort-minPort (12,000) ports in total, fewer when other processes hold
// some. A full testscript pass takes four per script (268 for 67 scripts), so
// a single process can run it about 44 times (for example with -count) before
// RandomPort panics.
// This is mainly used for testing.
