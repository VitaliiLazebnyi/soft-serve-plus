// pushCreateTimeout is how long a repository created by an HTTP push may
// stay without refs, with no request to it in flight, before it is removed.
// git sends the push in a separate request after the ref advertisement that
// created the repository, and git-lfs uploads objects in between, so the
// repository cannot be removed when the advertisement ends.
var pushCreateTimeout = 10 * time.Minute

// pushCreates tracks repositories created by HTTP push-to-create that have
// no refs yet. The SSH push creates and pushes in one session and deletes
// the repository when the push fails; over HTTP the push may fail in a later
// request or never arrive. A listed repository is removed when a
// receive-pack request to it fails and leaves no ref, or when nothing has
// reached it for pushCreateTimeout and it still has no ref. It is kept
// instead if it was used meanwhile or a push over SSH to it is running; see
// backend.RemovePushCreatedRepository. A receive-pack request that succeeds
// without updating a ref, such as the probe git sends before a pack larger
// than http.postBuffer, only restarts the timeout. A repository leaves the
// list once a request to it ends and it has a ref.
//
// The list is kept in memory, so a repository still on it when the server
// stops is kept, empty, until someone deletes it. That errs on the side of
// keeping: nothing on disk tells such a repository apart from one created
// empty on purpose.
