# Running Soft Serve Plus as a Systemd Service

Most Linux OSes use Systemd as an init system and service management. You can
use Systemd to manage Soft Serve Plus as a service on your host machine.

The Soft Serve Plus deb/rpm packages come with Systemd service files
pre-packaged. You can download them from the
[releases page](https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus/releases).
Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus#installation)
for more information.

## Writing a Systemd Service File

> **Note** you can skip this section if you installed Soft Serve Plus from our
> deb/rpm packages.

Start by writing a Systemd service file to define how your Soft Serve Plus server
should start.

First, we need to specify where the data should live for our server. Here I
will be choosing `/var/local/lib/soft-serve` to store the server's data. Soft
Serve will look for this path in the `SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH` environment
variable.

Make sure this directory exists before proceeding. It will hold the
repositories, the database, the SSH host keys and the logs, so make it
readable only by the server user (`root` in this guide). Soft Serve Plus
creates a missing data directory with mode `0700`, but it keeps the mode of
a directory that already exists, so set it here. `install -d -m 700` also
fixes the mode of a directory you created before.

```sh
sudo install -d -m 700 /var/local/lib/soft-serve
```

We will also create a `/etc/soft-serve.conf` file for any extra server settings
that we want to override. It can hold secrets such as a database password, so
make it readable only by `root`. systemd reads it as `root`, so the server does
not need access to it.

```sh
sudo touch /etc/soft-serve.conf
sudo chmod 600 /etc/soft-serve.conf
```

```conf
# Config defined here will override the config in /var/local/lib/soft-serve/config.yaml
# Keys defined in `SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS` will be merged with
# the `initial_admin_keys` from /var/local/lib/soft-serve/config.yaml.
#
#SOFT_SERVE_GIT_LISTEN_ADDR=:9418
#SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR=:23232
#SOFT_SERVE_SSH_LISTEN_ADDR=:23231
#SOFT_SERVE_SSH_KEY_PATH=ssh/soft_serve_host_ed25519
#SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS='ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1...'
```

> **Note** Soft Serve Plus stores its server configuration and settings in
> `config.yaml` under its _data path_ directory specified using
> `SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH` environment variable.

Now, let's write a new `/etc/systemd/system/soft-serve.service` Systemd service file:

```conf
[Unit]
Description=Soft Serve Plus git server 🍦
Documentation=https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus
Requires=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/soft serve
Environment=SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH=/var/local/lib/soft-serve
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/soft-serve.conf
WorkingDirectory=/var/local/lib/soft-serve
# Keep the files the server creates (repositories, database, logs) out of
# reach of other local users.
UMask=0027

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Great, we now have a Systemd service file for Soft Serve Plus. The settings defined
here may vary depending on your specific setup. This assumes that you want to
run Soft Serve Plus as `root`. For more information on Systemd service files, refer
to
[systemd.service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html)

## Start Soft Serve Plus on boot

Now that we have our Soft Serve Plus Systemd service file in-place, let's go ahead
and enable and start Soft Serve Plus to run on-boot.

```sh
# Reload systemd daemon
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# Enable Soft Serve Plus to start on-boot
sudo systemctl enable soft-serve.service
# Start Soft Serve Plus now!!
sudo systemctl start soft-serve.service
```

You can monitor the server logs using `journalctl -u soft-serve.service`. Use
`-f` to _tail_ and follow the logs as they get written.
