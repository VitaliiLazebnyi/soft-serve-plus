</p>

Soft Serve Plus is a maintained fork of [Soft Serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) by
[Charm](https://charm.sh). Charm has sunset the original project and no longer
ships security updates for it, so fixes and new features land here instead.

The binary is still called `soft`, and configuration, environment variables
(`SOFT_SERVE_*`) and data layout are unchanged, so an existing Soft Serve
installation can switch to Soft Serve Plus in place.

A tasty, self-hostable Git server for the command line. 🍦

- Easy to navigate TUI available over SSH
- Clone repos over SSH, HTTP, or Git protocol
- Git LFS support with both HTTP and SSH backends
- Manage repos with SSH
- Create repos on demand with SSH or `git push`
- Browse repos, files and commits with SSH-accessible UI
- Print files over SSH with or without syntax highlighting and line numbers
- Easy access control
  - SSH authentication using public keys
  - Allow/disallow anonymous access
  - Add collaborators with SSH public keys
  - Repos can be public or private
  - User access tokens

## Where can I see it?

Start a server locally and connect to it over SSH:

```bash
# Start a server, making your SSH key the admin
SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" soft serve

# In another terminal: open the TUI
ssh localhost -p 23231

# Print out a directory tree for a repo
ssh localhost -p 23231 repo tree my-repo

# Print a file with syntax highlighting and line numbers
ssh localhost -p 23231 repo blob my-repo README.md -c -l
```

Or you can use Soft Serve Plus to browse local repositories using `soft browse
[directory]` or running `soft` within a Git repository.

## Installation

Soft Serve Plus is a single binary called `soft`.

Download a binary, or a `.deb`, `.rpm` or `.apk` package, from the
[releases][releases] page. Binaries are available for Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and
Windows. The Linux packages include a Systemd service.

[releases]: https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus/releases

A [Docker image][docker] is available as `ghcr.io/vitaliilazebnyi/soft-serve-plus`.

[docker]: https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus/blob/main/docker.md

Or build it from source (Go is required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus.git
cd soft-serve-plus
go install ./cmd/soft
```

> [!NOTE]
> Packages named `soft-serve` from Homebrew, Apt/Yum, Winget, Arch, Nix or
> Docker Hub install the original Soft Serve, without the changes in this fork.
> The Soft Serve Plus `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.apk` packages replace the original
> `soft-serve` package; for other installs, remove the original first.

## Setting up a server

Make sure `git` is installed, then run `soft serve`. That’s it.

This will create a `data` directory that will store all the repos, ssh keys,
and database.

By default, program configuration is stored within the `data` directory. But,
this can be overridden by setting a custom path to a config file with `SOFT_SERVE_CONFIG_LOCATION`
that is pre-created. If the file pointed to by `SOFT_SERVE_CONFIG_LOCATION` does
not exist, Soft Serve Plus refuses to start instead of falling back to the default
config. The one exception is `$SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH/config.yaml`, the default
location, where a default config is generated on the first start.

To change the default data path use `SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH` environment variable.

```sh
SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/soft-serve soft serve
```

Soft Serve Plus creates the data directory with mode `0700` and the default
`config.yaml` with mode `0600`, so other local users cannot read repositories,
the database or secrets. A directory or config that already exists keeps its
mode; tighten it yourself (`chmod 700 data`) if it is group- or world-readable.
Packages install `/etc/soft-serve.conf` with mode `0600`, and an upgrade
tightens an existing one that still has the old `0644` mode.

When you run Soft Serve Plus for the first time, make sure you have the
`SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS` environment variable is set to your ssh
authorized key. Any added key to this variable will be treated as admin with
full privileges.

Using this environment variable, Soft Serve Plus will create a new `admin` user that
has full privileges. You can rename and change the user settings later.

The keys are reconciled every time `soft serve` starts, not only the first
time (`soft admin migrate` does not do this). A key you add to
`initial_admin_keys` later is attached to the admin user that owns the other
configured keys, or, if no admin owns one, to the admin named `admin` (created
if there is no admin at all). If the configured keys belong to several admins,
or there are admins but none is named `admin`, the key is not attached to
anyone and a warning is logged; it is still an admin key through the config.
A key that already belongs to a non-admin user is left on that user, who is
not promoted; a warning is logged.

To rotate a key, replace it in `initial_admin_keys` and restart. A key that
was attached on a later start is removed from the user it was attached to when
it leaves the config, even if that user is no longer an admin. Keys seeded on
the very first start, and keys added or removed with the `user` commands
since, stay in the database when you remove them from the config: remove those
with `user remove-pubkey`. To keep an attached key after dropping it from the
config, run `user remove-pubkey` and then `user add-pubkey` for it first.

Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored, and so is an entry that is
neither a key nor a file path (a warning counts them). But while an entry names
a key file that cannot be read or holds no key (for example a secret that is
not mounted yet, or a stale path), no key is removed, since the file may hold
a key that is still wanted: an error names the file and every key kept because
of it. Fix or remove the entry to let the removal happen. Every instance that
shares a database must use the same `initial_admin_keys`: a run with a
different list attaches and removes keys to match its own list.

If you'd like a repository to exist the moment the server finishes booting,
with no human logging in to run `repo create`, set `SOFT_SERVE_DEFAULT_REPO`
to a repository name. This is useful for GitOps tools like ArgoCD that need a
git remote to point at as part of their own bootstrap (e.g. from a Helm chart
or Terraform apply):

```sh
SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" \
SOFT_SERVE_DEFAULT_REPO=gitops \
  soft serve
```

The repository is created empty, exactly as if a human had run
`repo create gitops` with no flags: public, or private when `default_private`
is set; only its *existence* is guaranteed on
boot, not its reachability, which is still governed entirely by the
`anon-access`/`allow-keyless` settings described below. Booting again against
the same data directory is a no-op if the repository already exists. The
repository is owned by the admin user with the lowest ID; if there is no admin
user, it is not created and a warning is logged.

Check out [Systemd][systemd] on how to run Soft Serve Plus as a service using
Systemd. The `.deb` and `.rpm` packages from the [releases][releases] page come
with a Systemd service unit.

### Server Configuration

Once you start the server for the first time, the settings will be in
`config.yaml` under your data directory. The default `config.yaml` is
self-explanatory and will look like this:

```yaml
# Soft Serve Plus Server configurations

# The name of the server.
# This is the name that will be displayed in the UI.
name: "Soft Serve Plus"

# Logging configuration.
log:
  # Log format to use. Valid values are "json", "logfmt", and "text".
  format: "text"
  # Time format for the log "timestamp" field.
  # Should be described in Golang's time format.
  time_format: "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
  # Path to the log file. Leave empty to write to stderr.
  #path: ""

# The SSH server configuration.
ssh:
  # Enable SSH.
  enabled: true

  # The address on which the SSH server will listen.
  listen_addr: ":23231"

  # The public URL of the SSH server.
  # This is the address that will be used to clone repositories.
  public_url: "ssh://localhost:23231"

  # The path to the SSH server's private key.
  key_path: "ssh/soft_serve_host_ed25519"

  # The path to the server's client private key. This key will be used to
  # authenticate the server to make git requests to ssh remotes.
  client_key_path: "ssh/soft_serve_client_ed25519"

  # How the server's ssh client verifies host keys of ssh remotes it imports
  # or mirrors from, checked against <data_path>/ssh/known_hosts.
  # "accept-new" records a host key on first contact and refuses a changed
  # one (needs OpenSSH 7.6 or newer). "yes" refuses any host that is not
  # already in known_hosts; use it with a pre-seeded known_hosts file. The
  # client always runs with BatchMode=yes, so it fails fast instead of
  # prompting for a passphrase.
  client_strict_host_key_checking: "accept-new"

  # The ssh hosts that repositories may be imported from or mirrored. The
  # client key above is presented to every host a user imports from, so list
  # only hosts you trust that key with. Entries are hostnames, IP addresses,
  # or CIDR ranges, each with an optional port. When the list is empty, only
  # server admins may import from or mirror ssh remotes. Once the list is
  # non-empty it binds admins too: they may then reach only the hosts it
  # names. A mirror is synced with its owner's privileges, so mirroring
  # from ssh needs an owner with the admin flag or a host on this list.
  # CIDR entries are checked against DNS only at import or sync time and ssh
  # resolves the name again, so prefer hostnames for anything you do not
  # control. The list is matched against the name given to ssh; your
  # ssh_config still applies to it.

  idle_timeout: 600

  # The number of seconds a client has to complete the key exchange and
  # authenticate before the connection is closed.
  # A value of 0 means no timeout.
  handshake_timeout: 120

  # The key exchange algorithms, ciphers and MACs the SSH server offers, in
  # order of preference. When a list is empty, the server offers every
  # algorithm golang.org/x/crypto/ssh considers secure, which leaves out the
  # SHA-1 based diffie-hellman-group14-sha1, diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,
  # diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1, hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha1-96. Names
  # x/crypto does not implement are rejected at startup. A list replaces the
  # default, so to let an old client that only speaks SHA-1 connect, copy the
  # full default list and append the legacy algorithm. Listing fewer would
  # drop the rest, such as the post-quantum mlkem768x25519-sha256:

  # connection is reused or may sit idle. With Postgres, set max_open_conns
  # below the server's max_connections (minus what other clients use) so a

# Repository webhook configuration.
webhook:
  # Private and internal destinations webhooks may be sent to. Webhooks to
  # loopback, private networks and other internal addresses are refused
  # unless listed here. Entries are hostnames, IP addresses, or CIDR ranges,
  # each with an optional port (a URL without a port uses 80 for http and
  # 443 for https). An IP or CIDR entry allows the addresses it covers,

  # name to resolve to loopback, RFC1918, CGNAT or IPv6 unique local
  # addresses, and the name is resolved again for every delivery, so list
  # only names whose DNS you trust. Link-local and cloud metadata addresses
  # (such as 169.254.169.254) are reachable only through an IP or CIDR entry
  # inside their own range; a broad range such as 0.0.0.0/0 does not open

# Only server admins (admin accounts or initial_admin_keys) may create

# whatever anon_access says. Access to existing repositories is not affected.
# Defaults to false.
#admin_only_create: false

# Maximum number of repositories each user may create (repo create, repo
# import and push-to-create). Server admins are exempt, and repositories
# created without an account all count together as one user. A user at the
# limit is refused; existing repositories are kept. Imports still running
# count against the limit. 0 means no limit.
#max_repos_per_user: 0

# Make repositories created without an explicit visibility private:
# push-to-create over SSH and HTTP, repo create and repo import without
# --private, and default_repo. "repo create --private=false" still creates a
# public repository. An anonymous user could not access a private
# repository (it would be owned by the default admin), so when this is set
# anonymous push-to-create is refused, and anonymous repo create and repo
# import need --private=false. Defaults to false (such repositories are
# public).
#default_private: false

# Name of a repository to create automatically on boot if it doesn't already
# exist. Empty disables this behavior.
#default_repo: ""
```

You can also use environment variables, to override these settings. All server
settings environment variables start with `SOFT_SERVE_` followed by the setting
name all in uppercase. Here are some examples:

- `SOFT_SERVE_NAME`: The name of the server that will appear in the TUI
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_LISTEN_ADDR`: SSH listen address
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_KEY_PATH`: SSH host key-pair path
- `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR`: HTTP listen address
- `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL`: HTTP public URL used for cloning
- `SOFT_SERVE_GIT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: The number of simultaneous connections to git daemon
- `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_MAX_TIMEOUT`, `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT`, `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: Seconds a git or LFS request over HTTP may take in all (default `0`, no limit) or go without reading the request body or writing the response (default `60`), and how many such requests are served at once (default `64`; more get 503). `0` means no limit
- `SOFT_SERVE_ANON_ACCESS`: Overrides the `anon-access` setting (see [Authentication](#authentication))
- `SOFT_SERVE_ALLOW_KEYLESS`: Overrides the `allow-keyless` setting (see [Authentication](#authentication))
- `SOFT_SERVE_ADMIN_ONLY_CREATE`: Only server admins may create repositories. Owners and admin-access collaborators can no longer rename repositories, and anonymous access to names that do not exist yet is capped at read-only. Defaults to `false`. Access to existing repositories is not affected.
- `SOFT_SERVE_MAX_REPOS_PER_USER`: Maximum number of repositories each user may create. Server admins are exempt, and repositories created without an account count together as one user. Defaults to `0` (no limit).
- `SOFT_SERVE_DEFAULT_PRIVATE`: Make repositories created without an explicit visibility (push-to-create, `repo create` and `repo import` without `--private`, `default_repo`) private. Defaults to `false`. When set, anonymous push-to-create is refused, and anonymous `repo create` and `repo import` need `--private=false`, since an anonymous user could not access the private repository.
- `SOFT_SERVE_DEFAULT_REPO`: Repository name to create on boot if missing
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_KEX_ALGORITHMS`, `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_CIPHERS`, `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_MACS`: Comma-separated lists of the SSH key exchange algorithms, ciphers and MACs to offer. Empty means the secure defaults (see [SSH Algorithms](#ssh-algorithms))
- `SOFT_SERVE_DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS`, `SOFT_SERVE_DB_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`: Database connection pool limits. `0` (the default) keeps the database/sql defaults: no limit on open connections and 2 idle connections
- `SOFT_SERVE_DB_CONN_MAX_LIFETIME`, `SOFT_SERVE_DB_CONN_MAX_IDLE_TIME`: Seconds a database connection may be reused, or may sit idle, before it is closed. `0` (the default) means no limit
- `SOFT_SERVE_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated private or internal hosts, IP addresses or CIDR ranges (each with an optional port) that webhooks may be sent to (see [Repository webhooks](#repository-webhooks)). Defaults to empty: public addresses only.
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_CLIENT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated ssh hosts, IP addresses or CIDR ranges (each with an optional port) that repositories may be imported from or mirrored (see `client_allowed_hosts` above). Defaults to empty: only server admins may import from or mirror ssh remotes.
- `SOFT_SERVE_LOG_FORMAT`, `SOFT_SERVE_LOG_TIME_FORMAT`, `SOFT_SERVE_LOG_PATH`: Log format, timestamp format and log file (`log.format`, `log.time_format`, `log.path`). An empty path logs to stderr

Every setting in `config.yaml` has one, named after its path: `ssh.listen_addr`
is `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_LISTEN_ADDR`, `git.enabled` is `SOFT_SERVE_GIT_ENABLED`.
List settings take a comma-separated value, except
`SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEYS`, which takes one key (or key file path) per
line.

A few environment variables have no `config.yaml` setting:

- `SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH`: The data directory (see above). Defaults to `data`
- `SOFT_SERVE_CONFIG_LOCATION`: Path to an existing config file to use instead of `<data path>/config.yaml`
- `SOFT_SERVE_DEBUG`: Set to `true` to log at debug level, including SSH authentication attempts
- `SOFT_SERVE_VERBOSE`: Set to `true`, together with `SOFT_SERVE_DEBUG`, to also log the caller, database queries, and each SSH session's client key and environment
- `SOFT_SERVE_NO_COLOR`: Set to `1` to turn off colors in the `soft` command's output and syntax coloring in `repo blob -c`

#### SSH Algorithms

The SSH server offers the key exchange algorithms, ciphers and MACs that
[golang.org/x/crypto/ssh](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#SupportedAlgorithms)
considers secure, minus `hmac-sha1`. With the current x/crypto that is:

- key exchange: `mlkem768x25519-sha256`, `curve25519-sha256` (and its alias `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org`), `ecdh-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdh-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdh-sha2-nistp521`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`, `diffie-hellman-group16-sha512`, `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256`
- ciphers: `aes128-gcm@openssh.com`, `aes256-gcm@openssh.com`, `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`, `aes128-ctr`, `aes192-ctr`, `aes256-ctr`
- MACs: `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`, `hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com`, `hmac-sha2-256`, `hmac-sha2-512`

Earlier versions offered x/crypto's defaults, which also include the SHA-1
based `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, `hmac-sha1` and `hmac-sha1-96`. To
restrict the server further, for example to drop the NIST curves, set
`ssh.kex_algorithms`, `ssh.ciphers` or `ssh.macs` (or the environment
variables above). A list replaces the default rather than adding to it, and
a name x/crypto does not implement stops the server at startup.

**Older clients.** The host key Soft Serve Plus generates by default is
Ed25519, and the clients we checked that can verify an Ed25519 host key all
agree on the defaults: OpenSSH 6.6 and later (Ed25519 arrived in 6.5),
libssh2 1.10 (Ubuntu 22.04), and the maintained JSch fork
(`com.github.mwiede:jsch`) on Java 15 or later. Clients without Ed25519 host
key support cannot verify the default host key, with or without this
setting: OpenSSH before 6.5, libssh2 1.8 (Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, used by
libgit2 based tools there), and the original JCraft JSch up to 0.1.55. With
an RSA host key (`ssh.key_path`), libssh2 1.8 and JSch 0.1.55 do connect
with the defaults, using `diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256` (or ECDH for
JSch), `aes128-ctr` and `hmac-sha2-256`. The host key also signs the tokens
from `ssh … jwt` and git-lfs over SSH, as EdDSA for Ed25519, RS256 for RSA
and ES256, ES384 or ES512 for ECDSA, so these keep working with any host key
type. Replacing the host key invalidates tokens issued before.

A client limited to SHA-1 key exchange or MACs is refused. To let one in,
copy the default list above and append the legacy algorithm. Listing only a
few algorithms would drop the rest, including the post-quantum
`mlkem768x25519-sha256`, for every client:

```yaml
ssh:

#### Database Configuration

Soft Serve Plus supports both SQLite and Postgres for its database. Like all other Soft Serve Plus settings, you can change the database _driver_ and _data source_ using either `config.yaml` or environment variables. The default config uses SQLite as the default database driver.

To use Postgres as your database, first create a Soft Serve Plus database:

```sh
psql -h<hostname> -p<port> -U<user> -c 'CREATE DATABASE soft_serve'
```

Then set the database _data source_ to point to your Postgres database. For instance, if you're running Postgres locally, using the default user `postgres` and using a database name `soft_serve`, you would have this config in your config file or environment variable:

```
db:
  driver: "postgres"
  data_source: "postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/soft_serve?sslmode=disable"
```

Environment variables equivalent:

```sh
SOFT_SERVE_DB_DRIVER=postgres \
SOFT_SERVE_DB_DATA_SOURCE="postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/soft_serve?sslmode=disable" \
soft serve
```

You can specify a database connection password in the _data source_ url. For example, `postgres://myuser:dbpass@localhost:5432/my_soft_serve_db`.

Soft Serve Plus always sets the session `TimeZone` to UTC, overriding any
`timezone` in the data source and the server's default, because it stores
times in UTC.

By default the connection pool has no limit on open connections, so a burst
of requests can use up Postgres' `max_connections`. Set `db.max_open_conns`
(and optionally `db.max_idle_conns`, `db.conn_max_lifetime` and
`db.conn_max_idle_time`) to bound it; requests beyond the limit wait for a
free connection:

```
db:
  driver: "postgres"
  data_source: "postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/soft_serve?sslmode=disable"
  max_open_conns: 20
  max_idle_conns: 5
  conn_max_lifetime: 1800
```

The same settings apply to SQLite, whose defaults are unchanged: writers
already take turns through `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and `busy_timeout`, so SQLite
needs no limit.

#### LFS Configuration

Soft Serve Plus supports both Git LFS [HTTP](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/README.md) and [SSH](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/proposals/ssh_adapter.md) protocols out of the box, there is no need to do any extra set up.

Use the `lfs` config section to customize your Git LFS server.

> **Note**: The pure-SSH transfer is disabled by default.

Without it, Git LFS over an SSH remote asks `git-lfs-authenticate` for an HTTP
token, which is issued for an account. A key that belongs to no account,
even one with anonymous read access, is refused with an error that says so;
use an HTTP(S) remote for LFS instead, or register the key.

#### Maintenance Commands

`soft admin` runs maintenance against the data directory and database from
the same configuration as `soft serve`:

- `soft admin migrate`: Apply pending database migrations. `soft serve` also
  does this on start.
- `soft admin rollback`: Roll the database back by one migration.
- `soft admin sync-hooks`: Write the generated git hooks of every repository
  again, for example after moving the `soft` binary or the data directory.
  `soft serve --sync-hooks` does the same before starting the server.

## Server Access

Soft Serve Plus at its core manages your server authentication and authorization. Authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization determines their access rights to a repository.

To manage the server users, access, and repos, you can use the SSH command line interface.

Try `ssh localhost -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -p 23231 help` for more info. Make sure
you use your key here.

> **Note** The `IdentitiesOnly` option is used to prevent SSH from using any
> other keys in your `~/.ssh` directory. This is useful when you have multiple
> keys, and you want to use a specific key for Soft Serve Plus.

For ease of use, instead of specifying the key, port, and hostname every time
you SSH into Soft Serve Plus, add your own Soft Serve Plus instance entry to your SSH
config. For instance, to use `ssh soft` instead of typing `ssh localhost -i
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -p 23231`, we can define a `soft` entry in our SSH config
file `~/.ssh/config`.

```conf
Host soft
  HostName localhost
  Port 23231
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Now, we can do `ssh soft` to SSH into Soft Serve Plus. Since `git` is also aware of
this config, you can use `soft` as the hostname for your clone commands.

```sh
git clone ssh://soft/dotfiles
# make changes
# add & commit
git push origin main
```

> **Note** The `-i` and `-o` parts will be omitted in the examples below for brevity. You
> can add your server settings to your sshconfig for quicker access.

### Authentication

Everything that needs authentication is done using SSH. Make sure you have
added an entry for your Soft Serve Plus instance in your `~/.ssh/config` file.

By default, Soft Serve Plus gives read-only permission to anonymous connections to
any of the above protocols. This is controlled by two settings `anon-access`
and `allow-keyless`.

- `anon-access`: Defines the access level for anonymous users. Available
  options are `no-access`, `read-only`, `read-write`, and `admin-access`.
  Default is `read-only`.
- `allow-keyless`: Whether to allow connections that don't use keys to pass.
  Setting this to `false` would disable SSH keyboard-interactive logins and
  anonymous HTTP and Git protocol connections. Default is `true`.

```sh
$ ssh -p 23231 localhost settings
Manage server settings

Usage:
  ssh -p 23231 localhost settings [command]

Available Commands:
  allow-keyless Set or get allow keyless access to repositories
  anon-access   Set or get the default access level for anonymous users

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for settings

Use "ssh -p 23231 localhost settings [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

> **Note** These settings can only be changed by admins.

When `allow-keyless` is disabled, connections that don't use SSH Public Key
authentication will get denied. This means anonymous cloning over HTTP(s) or
git:// will get denied; HTTP requests with an access token still work. It does
not restrict SSH to registered users: a client that offers any public key,
registered or not, is still let in with `anon-access`. To keep unregistered
keys out, set `anon-access` to `no-access`.

Meanwhile, `anon-access` controls the access level granted to connections that
use SSH Public Key authentication but are not registered users. The default
setting for this is `read-only`. This will grant anonymous connections that use
SSH Public Key authentication `read-only` access to public repos.

`anon-access` is also used in combination with `allow-keyless` to determine the
access level for HTTP(s) and git:// clone requests.

#### Local/dev bootstrap

`anon-access` and `allow-keyless` are normally admin-only runtime settings,
which means scripting a fully open server from a cold start would otherwise
require booting with an admin key, waiting for the server to come up, then
SSHing in as that admin to run `settings` commands. For local development
tooling (e.g. standing up a throwaway Git remote for something like Argo CD
to pull from in a dev environment), you can instead set the `SOFT_SERVE_ANON_ACCESS`
and `SOFT_SERVE_ALLOW_KEYLESS` environment variables (or the equivalent
`anon_access`/`allow_keyless` `config.yaml` fields) to grant full,
unauthenticated access from the moment the server starts, with no admin key
and no `settings` command required:

```sh
SOFT_SERVE_ANON_ACCESS=admin-access \
SOFT_SERVE_ALLOW_KEYLESS=true \
  soft serve
```

> **Warning** This grants anyone who can reach the server full admin access
> with no authentication at all. It is intended strictly for local/dev use on
> a machine or network you trust — never expose a server configured this way
> to an untrusted network. The server logs a warning banner on startup
> whenever this combination is active.
>
> Unlike the `settings` command, these overrides always take precedence over
> the database for as long as they're set — not just on first run. If you
> also try to tighten access via `ssh soft settings ...` while an override is
> active, the change is saved but has no effect until the override is
> removed; the `settings` command will warn you when this happens.

#### SSH

Soft Serve Plus doesn't allow duplicate SSH public keys for users. A public key can be associated with one user only. This makes SSH authentication simple and straight forward, add your public key to your Soft Serve Plus user to be able to access Soft Serve Plus.

#### HTTP

You can generate user access tokens through the SSH command line interface. Access tokens can have an optional expiration date. Use your access token as the basic auth user to access your Soft Serve Plus repos through HTTP.

```sh
# Create a user token
ssh -p 23231 localhost token create 'my new token'
ss_1234abc56789012345678901234de246d798fghi

# Or with an expiry date
ssh -p 23231 localhost token create --expires-in 1y 'my other token'
ss_98fghi1234abc56789012345678901234de246d7
```

Now you can access repos that require `read-write` access. Give git the token
as the password (any username works) through a credential helper, so it is
not stored in the remote URL:

```sh
git clone http://localhost:23232/my-private-repo.git my-private-repo
# When prompted, enter any username and the token as the password.
# Your credential helper (e.g. osxkeychain, manager, libsecret) remembers it.
# Make changes and push
```

You can also put the token in the URL as the username
(`http://ss_98fg…@localhost:23232/my-private-repo.git`), but avoid it: the URL
ends up in `.git/config` and shell history, and some git builds (for example
Homebrew git on macOS) drop credentials embedded in the URL and then fail to
push.

### Authorization

Soft Serve Plus offers a simple access control. There are four access levels,
no-access, read-only, read-write, and admin-access.

`admin-access` has full control of the server and can make changes to users and repos.
Given to a collaborator, it only applies to that repo.

`read-write` access can push to repos and change their content and metadata.
Deleting or renaming a repo, changing whether it is private, and managing its
webhooks need `admin-access` to that repo, which its owner always has. With
`anon-access: read-write`, anonymous users can push to public repos but can't
delete, rename or change the visibility of any of them.

`read-only` can read public repos.

On a public repo, `anon-access` is a floor for everyone: registered users and
collaborators never get less than an anonymous caller would, so with
`anon-access: read-write` every user can push to public repos, and a
`read-only` collaborator on a public repo has read-write. Registered users
always have at least `read-only` on public repos. On a private repo,
`anon-access` does not apply: only the owner, collaborators (at their own
level) and admins have access.

`no-access` denies access to all repos.

## User Management

Admins can manage users and their keys using the `user` command. Once a user is
created and has access to the server, they can manage their own keys and
settings.

To create a new user simply use `user create`:

```sh
# Create a new user
ssh -p 23231 localhost user create beatrice

# Add user keys
ssh -p 23231 localhost user add-pubkey beatrice ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...
ssh -p 23231 localhost user add-pubkey beatrice ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

# Create another user with public key
ssh -p 23231 localhost user create frankie '-k "ssh-ed25519 AAAATzN..."'

# Need help?
ssh -p 23231 localhost user help
```

Once a user is created, they get `read-only` access to public repositories.
They can also create new repositories on the server.

Users can manage their keys using the `pubkey` command:

```sh
# List user keys
ssh -p 23231 localhost pubkey list

# Add key
ssh -p 23231 localhost pubkey add ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

# Wanna change your username?
ssh -p 23231 localhost set-username yolo

# To display user info
ssh -p 23231 localhost info
```

`pubkey add` does not ask for proof that you hold the key's private half, so
keys listed in `initial_admin_keys` get extra care:

- Only an admin can attach a listed key to an account (`user add-pubkey
  USERNAME KEY`). A non-admin running `pubkey add` with one gets an error
  saying the key is listed in `initial_admin_keys`. If you are a new admin
  whose key was just listed, ask an existing admin to attach it, or log in
  with that key: it already has admin rights from the config.
- If a listed key belongs to a non-admin account (for example, someone
  added it before it was listed), the server refuses SSH sessions with that
  key and logs a warning. The error names the account. If the account is
  the key holder's own, make it an admin with `user set-admin USERNAME
  true`; otherwise remove the key from it with `user remove-pubkey USERNAME
  KEY` (and attach it to the right account with `user add-pubkey`). HTTP
  access is not affected: it is admin only for accounts with the admin
  flag.

To promote an existing user, run `user set-admin USERNAME true`. Listing
their key in `initial_admin_keys` alone locks them out over SSH until you
do.

## Repositories

You can manage repositories using the `repo` command.

```sh
# Run repo help
$ ssh -p 23231 localhost repo help
Manage repositories

Usage:
  ssh -p 23231 localhost repo [command]

Aliases:
  repo, repos, repository, repositories

Available Commands:
  blob         Print out the contents of file at path
  branch       Manage repository branches
  collab       Manage collaborators
  commit       Print out the contents of a diff
  create       Create a new repository
  delete       Delete a repository
  description  Set or get the description for a repository
  hidden       Hide or unhide a repository
  import       Import a new repository from remote
  info         Get information about a repository
  list         List repositories
  mirror       Set or get a repository mirror property
  private      Set or get a repository private property
  project-name Set or get the project name for a repository
  rename       Rename an existing repository
  tag          Manage repository tags
  tree         Print repository tree at path
  webhook      Manage repository webhooks

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for repo

Use "ssh -p 23231 localhost repo [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Each `repo` command needs a level of access to the repository (see
[Authorization](#authorization)): commands that only read it, such as `info`,
`tree` and `blob`, need `read-only`; `create` and `import`, changing its
branches, tags or metadata, and listing or changing its collaborators need
`read-write`; and deleting or renaming it, changing whether it is private, and
managing its webhooks need `admin-access`. Unless you are a server admin, you
can only give a collaborator an access level up to your own, and you can't
remove or change a collaborator whose level is higher than yours.

### Creating Repositories

To create a repository, first make sure you are a registered user. Use the
`repo create <repo>` command to create a new repository:

```sh
# Create a new repository
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream

# Create a repo with description
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"'

# ... and project name
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"' '-n "Ice Cream"'

# I need my repository private!
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream -p '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"' '-n "Ice Cream"'

# Help?
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create -h
```

Or you can add your Soft Serve Plus server as a remote to any existing repo, given
you have write access, and push to remote:

```
git remote add origin ssh://localhost:23231/icecream
```

After you’ve added the remote just go ahead and push. If the repo doesn’t exist
on the server it’ll be created.

```
git push origin main
```

By default, new repositories are public: a pushed repository, and one made
by `repo create` or `repo import` without `--private` (`-p`). An admin can set
`default_private: true` (`SOFT_SERVE_DEFAULT_PRIVATE`) to make them private
unless created with `--private=false`; see
[Server Configuration](#server-configuration). The TUI marks every repository
as private (🔒) or public (🌐), and `repo info` and `repo private` print it.

Over HTTP, git creates the repository with one request and pushes with the
next, so a push that fails or never arrives would leave an empty repository
behind. Soft Serve Plus removes a repository created this way if its push fails
without writing any ref, or if nothing has reached it for 10 minutes and it
still has none. It is kept if anything was done with it meanwhile: a
collaborator, webhook, LFS object or LFS lock added, or its description, project
name, visibility, hidden flag, mirror flag or owner changed, or the name now
belongs to a different repository. It is also kept if a push or LFS upload to it
over SSH is running when the removal comes due. Which repositories are waiting
for their push is only kept in memory, so one still waiting when the server
restarts is kept empty; delete it with `repo delete` if it is not wanted.

### Nested Repositories

Repositories can be nested too:

```sh
# Create a new nested repository
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create my-team/icecream

# Or ...
git remote add soft ssh://localhost:23231/my-team/icecream
git push soft main
```

### Mirrors

You can also *import* repositories from any public remote. Use the `repo import` command.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo import soft-serve-plus https://github.com/VitaliiLazebnyi/soft-serve-plus
```

Use `--mirror` or `-m` to mark the repository as a *pull* mirror. A mirror is synced on the `mirror_pull` schedule, and its syncs have the same transfer limits as an import: an HTTP transfer that stays below 1000 bytes a second for five minutes is aborted, and so is an ssh connection that takes more than 30 seconds to set up or whose server stops answering for a minute. A large remote that sends nothing for five minutes while it prepares the pack can fail its syncs this way.

An import runs while the `repo import` command does: closing the session, or stopping the server, stops it and removes what it had created. An import is also given up after an hour, and is aborted by the same transfer limits as a mirror sync (see above). The server runs at most 16 imports at once, and each user at most 2 (server admins are exempt from the per-user cap); beyond that `repo import` is refused until one finishes.

Imports and mirror syncs need git 2.37 or newer on the server. Older git cannot pin an http(s) remote to the address the server checked, so a remote could be pointed at an internal address after the check; with such a git, imports and mirror syncs are refused and the reason is logged.

When a mirror uses Git LFS, each sync only scans the history it fetched since the last sync that stored every LFS object, and once a day it scans the whole history to fetch object files that went missing. Deleting `<data_path>/lfs/<repo id>/scanned-refs` makes the next sync scan the whole history.

### Deleting Repositories

You can delete repositories using the `repo delete <repo>` command.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo delete icecream
```

### Renaming Repositories

Use the `repo rename <old> <new>` command to rename existing repositories.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo rename icecream vanilla
```

### Repository Collaborators

Sometimes you want to restrict write access to certain repositories. This can
be achieved by adding a collaborator to your repository.

Use the `repo collab <command> <repo>` command to manage repo collaborators.

```sh
# Add collaborator to soft-serve-plus
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab add soft-serve-plus frankie

# Add collaborator with a specific access level
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab add soft-serve-plus beatrice read-only

# Remove collaborator
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab remove soft-serve-plus beatrice

# List collaborators
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab list soft-serve-plus
```

A `read-write` collaborator can push and edit the repo's branches, tags and
metadata. Only the owner, server admins and `admin-access` collaborators can
delete or rename the repo, change whether it is private, or manage its
webhooks.

### Repository Metadata

You can also change the repo's description, project name, whether it's private,
etc using the `repo <command>` command.

```sh
# Set description for repo
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo description icecream "This is a new description"

# Hide repo from listing
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo hidden icecream true

# List repository info (branches, tags, description, etc)
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo info icecream
```

To make a repository private, use `repo private <repo> [true|false]`. Private
repos can only be accessed by admins and collaborators.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo private icecream true
```

### Repository Branches & Tags

Use `repo branch` and `repo tag` to list, and delete branches or tags. You can
also use `repo branch default` to set or get the repository default branch.

### Repository Tree

To print a file tree for the project, just use the `repo tree` command along with
the repo name as the SSH command to your Soft Serve Plus server:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve-plus
```

You can also specify the sub-path and a specific reference or branch.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve-plus server/config
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve-plus main server/config
```

From there, you can print individual files using the `repo blob` command:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo blob soft-serve-plus cmd/soft/main.go
```

You can add the `-c` flag to enable syntax coloring and `-l` to print line
numbers:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo blob soft-serve-plus cmd/soft/main.go -c -l

```

Binary files are not printed unless you add `--raw`. The output always ends
with an added newline, so to get a byte-exact copy of a file, clone the
repository instead.

### Repository webhooks

Soft Serve Plus supports repository webhooks using the `repo webhook` command. You
can create and manage webhooks for different repository events such as _push_,
_collaborators_, and _branch_tag_create_ events.

```
Manage repository webhooks

Usage:
  ssh -p 23231 localhost repo webhook [command]

Aliases:
  webhook, webhooks

Available Commands:
  create      Create a repository webhook
  delete      Delete a repository webhook
  deliveries  Manage webhook deliveries
  list        List repository webhooks
  update      Update a repository webhook

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for webhook
```

Every attempt to send an event is recorded as a delivery, which `repo webhook
deliveries` lists and can redeliver. Each webhook keeps its 100 most recent
deliveries: recording one deletes the older ones. While deliveries are being
recorded concurrently, or if a cleanup fails, a webhook can briefly hold a few
more until its next delivery is recorded. Upgrading trims existing deliveries
to the same limit. The trim frees space inside the database but does not shrink
its files. On SQLite, stop the server and run `sqlite3 <database file> VACUUM`
to shrink the file; VACUUM writes a full copy, so it needs free disk space up
to about the size of the file. On Postgres, autovacuum makes the space
reusable, and `VACUUM FULL webhook_deliveries` returns it to the system.

A repository can have at most 20 webhooks.

#### Delivery headers and signatures

Every webhook request carries these headers:

- `X-SoftServe-Event`: the event, such as `push` or `repository`.
- `X-SoftServe-Delivery`: a GUID for the event. A redelivery sends the GUID
  of the delivery it repeats, so a receiver can skip an event it has already
  handled.
- `X-SoftServe-Timestamp`: when the request was signed, in seconds since the
  Unix epoch. A redelivery gets a new timestamp.

A webhook with a secret also signs each request with HMAC-SHA256, keyed with
the secret:

- `X-SoftServe-Signature-V2`: `sha256=` and the hex HMAC of the timestamp, a
  `.`, the delivery GUID, a `.` and the request body. Check this one, reject
  timestamps too far from your clock (five minutes, say) and remember the
  GUIDs seen within that window to refuse replayed requests.
- `X-SoftServe-Signature`: `sha256=` and the hex HMAC of the body alone. It
  is kept for existing receivers; it does not stop a captured request from
  being replayed.

Compare signatures in constant time, for example with `hmac.Equal` in Go.

Repository events for a rename or a default branch change carry the old
value in `changes`, as `changes.name.from` or `changes.default_branch.from`.
Push events say whether the push was `forced` (the ref moved to a commit that
does not contain its old one) and who the `pusher` was; a push that creates a
branch or tag lists only the commits no other branch or tag already had.

#### Webhooks to internal services

Webhooks are protected against server-side request forgery: by default a
webhook URL may not point at loopback, a private network, a link-local or
cloud metadata address, or any other internal address. This is checked when a
webhook is created or updated, and again when each delivery connects, so a
name that later resolves to an internal address is refused too. Redirects are
never followed.

To send webhooks to an internal service such as a CI server, list it in
`webhook.allowed_hosts` (or `SOFT_SERVE_WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, comma
separated):

```yaml
webhook:
  allowed_hosts:
    - "jenkins.internal.example" # this name, on any port
    - "10.20.0.0/16"             # any URL whose addresses fall in this range
    - "127.0.0.1:8080"           # only port 8080 on loopback
```

The entries are trusted differently:

- An IP address or CIDR range allows the addresses it covers whatever host
  name the URL uses. It is checked against the address actually connected to,
  so DNS cannot get around it. Prefer it when the service has a fixed address.
- A hostname allows that name to resolve to loopback, RFC1918, CGNAT
  (100.64.0.0/10) and IPv6 unique local (fc00::/7) addresses. The name is
  resolved again for every delivery, so whoever controls its DNS decides
  which of those addresses is reached; list only names you trust. A hostname
  entry never opens anything else, and it does not cover other names that
  resolve to the same addresses. `localhost` names need a hostname entry.
- Link-local addresses, including the 169.254.169.254 metadata service, the
  other cloud metadata addresses (`fd00:ec2::254`, `fd00:ec2::23`,
  `fd20:ce::254`, `fd00:c1::a9fe:a9fe`, `100.100.100.200`) and the
  remaining reserved ranges can only be opened by an IP or CIDR entry inside
  that range, such as `169.254.169.254`; a broad entry such as `0.0.0.0/0`
  does not open them.
- An entry in an IPv6 transition range, such as NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) or
  6to4 (`2002::/16`), also reaches the IPv4 addresses embedded in the
  addresses it covers once a gateway translates them, metadata addresses
  included: `64:ff9b::/96` reaches 169.254.169.254 as `64:ff9b::a9fe:a9fe`.
  List such ranges only if you mean every IPv4 address behind them.

Every address a name resolves to must be public or allowed, otherwise the
webhook is refused. Existing webhooks follow the list in effect when they are
delivered: removing an entry stops deliveries to it, which are then recorded as
failed. The list applies to webhooks only. Git LFS transfers and HTTP repository
imports and mirrors are not affected by it.

## The Soft Serve Plus TUI

Soft Serve Plus TUI is mainly used to browse repos over SSH. You can also use it to
browse local repositories with `soft browse` or running `soft` within a Git
repository.

```sh
ssh localhost -p 23231
```

It's also possible to “link” to a specific repo:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost -t soft-serve-plus
```

The TUI's About tab shows the `README.md` of the `.soft-serve` repository.
Only a server admin can create that repository or rename one to it, and the
About tab shows its README only while a server admin owns it, and only to
users who can read it: make it private to show it to collaborators only. A
`.soft-serve` that an anonymous user created (possible before the name was
reserved, with `anon-access` set to `read-write`) is not shown; delete it and
create it again as an admin.

You can copy text to your clipboard over SSH. For instance, you can press
<kbd>c</kbd> on the highlighted repo in the menu to copy the clone command
[^osc52].

[^osc52]:
    Copying over SSH depends on your terminal support of OSC52. Refer to
    [go-osc52](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/go-osc52) for more information.

## Hooks

Soft Serve Plus supports git server-side hooks `pre-receive`, `update`,
`post-update`, and `post-receive`. This means you can define your own hooks to
run on repository push events. Hooks can be defined as a per-repository hook,
and/or global hooks that run for all repositories.

Per-repository hooks live in the repository's `hooks` directory,
`<data path>/repos/<repo>.git/hooks`. Soft Serve Plus owns the
`hooks/<name>` scripts there and writes them again when the repository is
created and on `soft admin sync-hooks` or `soft serve --sync-hooks`, so do not
edit them. Each one runs every executable file in `hooks/<name>.d/`, so put
your own per-repository hooks there, for example
`hooks/post-receive.d/notify`.

Global hooks live in `<data path>/hooks` (`SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH`) and run for
every repository. Defining global hooks is useful if you want to run CI/CD for
example. Global hooks run only when they are executable. Windows has no execute
bit, so there every global hook file is run with `sh`, the one that comes with
Git for Windows, the way git runs its own hooks.

Here's an example of sending a message after receiving a push event. Create an
executable file `<data path>/hooks/update`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#
# An example hook script to echo information about the push
# and send it to the client.

refname="$1"
oldrev="$2"
newrev="$3"

# Safety check
if [ -z "$GIT_DIR" ]; then
        echo "Don't run this script from the command line." >&2
        echo " (if you want, you could supply GIT_DIR then run" >&2
        echo "  $0 <ref> <oldrev> <newrev>)" >&2
        exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$refname" -o -z "$oldrev" -o -z "$newrev" ]; then
        echo "usage: $0 <ref> <oldrev> <newrev>" >&2
        exit 1
fi

# Check types
# if $newrev is 0000...0000, it's a commit to delete a ref.
zero=$(git hash-object --stdin </dev/null | tr '[0-9a-f]' '0')
if [ "$newrev" = "$zero" ]; then
        newrev_type=delete
else
        newrev_type=$(git cat-file -t $newrev)
fi

echo "Hi from Soft Serve Plus update hook!"
echo
echo "RefName: $refname"
echo "Change Type: $newrev_type"
echo "Old SHA1: $oldrev"
echo "New SHA1: $newrev"

exit 0
```

Now, you should get a message after pushing changes to any repository.

## A note about RSA keys

RSA keys work: the server accepts RSA signatures made with SHA-2
(`rsa-sha2-256` and `rsa-sha2-512`), which current OpenSSH clients use, as
well as the legacy SHA-1 `ssh-rsa` signatures of older clients. Ed25519 keys
are still the better choice for new keys. Not sure what type of keys you
have? You can check with the following:

```sh
$ find ~/.ssh/id_*.pub -exec ssh-keygen -l -f {} \;
```
